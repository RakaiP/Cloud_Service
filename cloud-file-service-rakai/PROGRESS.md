# Cloud File Sharing System - Progress Update

## âœ… Completed Components

### 1. Block Storage Service with MinIO âœ…
- FastAPI service storing chunks in MinIO (S3-compatible)
- Endpoints: POST/GET/DELETE/LIST chunks
- Health checks and error handling
- Docker integration working
- **Status: TESTED AND WORKING** ðŸŽ‰

### 2. Docker Infrastructure âœ…
- All services containerized and running
- MinIO console accessible at localhost:9001
- Service orchestration with docker-compose
- Health checks for all services

### 3. Database Services âœ…
- PostgreSQL for metadata-service
- PostgreSQL for sync-service
- Both databases healthy and accessible

## ðŸš§ Next Priority Tasks

### 1. **Integrate Services** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Connect metadata-service to block-storage
- [ ] File chunking logic in metadata-service
- [ ] Register chunk metadata when uploading

### 2. **Client SDK Development** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Python SDK for file upload/download
- [ ] File chunking algorithm (split large files)
- [ ] File reconstruction (reassemble chunks)
- [ ] Progress tracking for uploads

### 3. **API Integration** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Metadata service calls block-storage for chunks
- [ ] Sync service integration for file events
- [ ] End-to-end file upload/download flow

### 4. **Authentication** (LOWER PRIORITY)
- [ ] Test Auth0 integration
- [ ] Secure all endpoints
- [ ] User-specific file access

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Next Step

**Build File Upload Flow:**
1. Client chunks a file
2. Uploads chunks to block-storage (âœ… DONE)
3. Registers file metadata with metadata-service
4. Triggers sync event

Would you like to work on:
- **A) Client SDK** for file chunking and upload?
- **B) Metadata service** integration with block-storage?
- **C) Complete end-to-end** upload/download flow?
