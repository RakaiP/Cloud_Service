# Cloud File Service (Google Drive Clone) - Progress Report

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. Block Storage Service
- FastAPI microservice for chunk storage
- MinIO integration for S3-compatible object storage
- Endpoints for chunk upload, download, delete, and listing
- Dockerized and health-checked

### 2. Metadata Service
- FastAPI microservice for file metadata, versioning, and chunk tracking
- PostgreSQL integration for persistent metadata storage
- Endpoints for file CRUD, versioning, and chunk registration
- Auth0 JWT authentication enforced on protected endpoints
- Dockerized and health-checked

### 3. Sync Service
- FastAPI microservice for file sync events
- PostgreSQL integration for sync event persistence
- Endpoints for creating and listing sync events
- Auth0 JWT authentication
- Dockerized and health-checked

### 4. Frontend
- Nginx static frontend with file upload UI
- JS client supports chunked uploads to block storage
- Dockerized and integrated with backend services

### 5. Chunker (Client Agent)
- Service for client-side file chunking and upload orchestration
- Communicates with metadata, block storage, and sync services
- Dockerized

### 6. Infrastructure
- Docker Compose orchestrates all services and databases
- MinIO for object storage, two PostgreSQL databases
- Health checks for all services

## üü° In Progress / Next Steps

- [ ] Device management endpoints in sync service (register/list devices)
- [ ] Sync queue per device (pending syncs, completion tracking)
- [ ] Real-time sync (WebSocket endpoints in sync service)
- [ ] Integration webhooks between metadata and sync services
- [ ] Enhanced event data (file metadata in sync events)
- [ ] Client SDK improvements (auto device registration, polling, notifications)

## üìù Testing & Validation

- All core endpoints tested via cURL and integration scripts
- Auth0 authentication verified (403 on protected endpoints without token)
- End-to-end file upload and download flow works with valid token
- Docker Compose test suite for CI

## üöÄ Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: Nginx static UI (port 80)
- **Chunker**: Client agent for chunking/upload (port 8080)
- **Metadata Service**: File metadata/versioning (port 8000)
- **Sync Service**: File sync events (port 8001)
- **Block Storage**: Chunk storage via MinIO (port 8003)
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage (ports 9000/9001)
- **PostgreSQL**: Metadata and sync databases

## üü¢ Current Status

- Core microservices are running and integrated
- Auth, storage, and metadata flows are functional
- Ready for advanced sync and device management features

---

**Next milestone:** Implement device management and real-time sync in the sync service, then polish client SDK for production use.
